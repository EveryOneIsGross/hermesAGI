## Hermeticism and the Roundtable Nature of Hermes' Philosophical Works

hermes³AGI draws inspiration from Hermeticism, a philosophical and religious tradition based on the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. The teachings of Hermes, often presented in the form of dialogues or roundtable discussions, emphasize the pursuit of gnosis — knowledge of the divine or mystical insight. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this roundtable nature through the interaction of different "Principle agents".

In Hermeticism, the universe is seen as a coherent whole where everything is interconnected, mirroring the interconnected nature of the principles this AI is based on, where each principle is part of a greater whole. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this interconnectedness by using the AI to generate responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also connected to the wisdom and guidance of the philosophical principles.

## Aligning AI to Your Will Through Philosophical Principles

The philosophical principles, in the context of hermes³AGI, are used as a method for aligning the AI to the will of the user. By embodying the archetypes of these principles in AI agents, we can guide the AI in generating responses that align with the wisdom and guidance of the principles. This allows the user to harness the power of these principles to guide the AI, aligning the AI's responses with the user's will.

## Aims for Answer Enrichment

The aim of hermes³AGI is to enrich the responses generated by the AI by incorporating the wisdom and guidance of the philosophical principles. Each principle agent has its own unique guidance prompt and response characteristics, which are used to guide the AI in generating responses. This allows the AI to provide responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also imbued with the wisdom and guidance of the principle agent.

## How does this work?

The script provided is a robust chatbot system that utilizes principles of esoteric knowledge in the AI alignment framework. This system leverages the OpenAI GPT-3 model and operates under the idea that different principles can have unique perspectives on a question or topic. Let's break down how it does this:

Initialization

The script begins by setting up two key classes: ChatBot and HermesHermesHermes. Each class is initialized with an OpenAI model (the specific model may vary), an API key, and various file paths to store responses, conclusions, and keywords.

Processing Principles

The ChatBot class uses a method called process_principle to process each principle. It generates a response from the OpenAI model and saves the response in a JSON file. The response is generated by providing a prompt to the model that includes the principle's description, any previous thoughts on that principle, and the user's question.

It then generates a "conclusion", which is a summary of the principle's response, and appends this conclusion to the existing data. The conclusion and the response are saved in separate JSON files.

The process_principle function also uses the TextBlob library to extract keywords from the conclusion and stores them in a separate JSON file. This is a unique use of natural language processing to identify key ideas or themes in the model's response.

Processing Questions

ChatBot's process_question method accepts a user's question and applies it to a list of pre-defined principles, such as the "principle of correspondence" or the "principle of mentalism". For each principle, it uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the process_principle method concurrently, which helps improve efficiency. The method handles any RateLimitErrors and returns a list of tuples, each containing the principle's name, response, conclusion, and extracted keywords.

Generating Summaries

HermesHermesHermes is responsible for generating a comprehensive summary based on the conclusions and keywords from the different principles. It uses the OpenAI model to generate a holistic answer based on the principle's conclusions and keywords, and stores the generated response in a JSON file.

The generate_summary method generates a prompt that summarizes the conclusions and keywords of all principles, and then asks the OpenAI model for "actionable wisdom" based on this summary. The response from the model is saved and returned as the summary.

The Main Loop

In the main loop of the script, the user is prompted to ask a question or say 'bye' to exit. If the user asks a question, it is processed using the ChatBot's process_question method, which generates responses, conclusions, and keywords for each principle. The HermesHermesHermes then generates a holistic answer based on these responses. This process repeats until the user decides to exit.

Unique Aspects

The unique aspect of this script is the way it uses esoteric principles to guide the AI's responses. The principles serve as a framework for interpreting and responding to the user's question, which is quite different from the way most chatbot frameworks operate. This could potentially lead to more nuanced and thoughtful responses. Furthermore, the use of TextBlob for keyword extraction and the concurrent execution of tasks are notable implementation details that enhance the functionality of this chatbot system.

Memory 

The use of JSON for memory retention in this script is a crucial part of how the chatbot learns and evolves over time. This approach essentially provides a form of 'memory' for the bot, allowing it to reference past interactions and build upon them in future ones. Here's how it works:

Response Memory: In the process_principle function of the ChatBot class, the bot generates a response to the user's question, which is then stored in a JSON file. This file serves as a memory of all past responses related to a specific principle. When generating a new response, the bot reads the existing responses from this file and includes them in the prompt it sends to the OpenAI model. By doing this, the bot ensures that the model is aware of the context of previous discussions related to the principle, which influences the model's current response.

Conclusion Memory: The process_principle function also generates a 'conclusion' for each response, which is a summary of the principle's response to the question. These conclusions are stored in a separate JSON file. This 'conclusion memory' is then used by the HermesHermesHermes class when generating a summary of the principle's responses. By referencing the conclusions of past discussions, the bot can provide a more comprehensive and informed response to the user's question.

Keyword Memory: Finally, the process_principle function uses TextBlob to extract keywords from each conclusion, which are then stored in a separate JSON file. This 'keyword memory' provides a summary of the key themes and ideas discussed in relation to each principle. This is particularly useful when generating a summary of the principle's responses, as it allows the bot to highlight the most important points.

In summary, the use of JSON for memory retention enables the chatbot to build a rich context of past discussions that is used to guide future conversations. This makes the chatbot's responses more informed and nuanced, as they are not solely based on the user's current question, but also on the history of past interactions.
