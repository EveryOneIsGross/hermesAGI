## Conceptual and Philosophical Intentions

hermes³AGI is a unique exploration of the intersection between artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and the esoteric world of tarot. It's designed to simulate a conversation with different "tarot agents", each with their own unique guidance prompt and response characteristics. The philosophical intention behind hermes³AGI is to explore how AI can be used to emulate the rich symbolism and interpretive nature of tarot to further align our wills. The tarot is a great tool for introspection, for exploring our subconscious and the mysteries of the universe. By creating AI agents that embody the archetypes of the tarot, we can use the power of AI to delve into these mysteries and gain new insights, together.

## Hermeticism and the Anon Roundtable Nature of the Philosopher Hermes' Works

hermes³AGI draws inspiration from Hermeticism, a philosophical and religious tradition based on the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. The teachings of Hermes, often presented in the form of dialogues or roundtable discussions, emphasize the pursuit of gnosis — knowledge of the divine or mystical insight. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this roundtable nature through the interaction of different "tarot agents", each embodying a different aspect of the wisdom of the tarot.

In Hermeticism, the universe is seen as a coherent whole where everything is interconnected, mirroring the interconnected nature of the tarot where each card is part of a greater whole. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this interconnectedness by using the AI to generate responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also connected to the wisdom and guidance of the tarot.

## Occultism as a Method for Aligning AI to Your Will

Occultism, in the context of hermes³AGI, is used as a method for aligning the AI to the will of the user. By embodying the archetypes of the tarot in AI agents, we can guide the AI in generating responses that align with the wisdom and guidance of the tarot. This allows the user to harness the power of the tarot to guide the AI, aligning the AI's responses with the user's will.

## Aims for Answer Enrichment

The aim of hermes³AGI is to enrich the responses generated by the AI by incorporating the wisdom and guidance of the tarot. Each tarot agent has its own unique guidance prompt and response characteristics, which are used to guide the AI in generating responses. This allows the AI to provide responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also imbued with the wisdom and guidance of the tarot agent.
