## Conceptual and Philosophical Intentions

Hermeticism and the Roundtable Nature of Hermes' Philosophical Works

hermes³AGI draws inspiration from Hermeticism, a philosophical and religious tradition based on the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. The teachings of Hermes, often presented in the form of dialogues or roundtable discussions, emphasize the pursuit of gnosis — knowledge of the divine or mystical insight. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this roundtable nature through the interaction of different "Principle agents".

In Hermeticism, the universe is seen as a coherent whole where everything is interconnected, mirroring the interconnected nature of the principles this AI is based on, where each principle is part of a greater whole. hermes³AGI seeks to emulate this interconnectedness by using the AI to generate responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also connected to the wisdom and guidance of the philosophical principles.

Aligning AI to Your Will Through Philosophical Principles

The philosophical principles, in the context of hermes³AGI, are used as a method for aligning the AI to the will of the user. By embodying the archetypes of these principles in AI agents, we can guide the AI in generating responses that align with the wisdom and guidance of the principles. This allows the user to harness the power of these principles to guide the AI, aligning the AI's responses with the user's will.

Aims for Answer Enrichment

The aim of hermes³AGI is to enrich the responses generated by the AI by incorporating the wisdom and guidance of the philosophical principles. Each principle agent has its own unique guidance prompt and response characteristics, which are used to guide the AI in generating responses. This allows the AI to provide responses that are not only relevant to the user's input, but also imbued with the wisdom and guidance of the principle agent.
